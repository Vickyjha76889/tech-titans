   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Add to your shell profile**
   ```bash
   echo 'export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   
   **Option 3: Create a .env file**
   ```bash
   echo 'GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here' > .env
   ```
